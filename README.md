# Dungeon Generation

## Context

I'm contemplating the idea of building a top-down procedural rogue-lite.

This repo aims to be a sandbox to learn and play around with various level generations techniques.

## Techniques

### Random rectangles

Draw rectangles of random sizes at random position within defined area.

First results are boring dungeons with no sense whatsoever. Rectangle rooms with large gaps between them. Those are not looking good.

Things start to get interesting when increasing the room count. Multiple rooms are now merging together creating more interesting uneven, organic looking play spaces.

Ideas to try out :

- Use other types of shapes like ellipses and triangles could yeld interesting results.
